Introduction
The Main.java file contains a Java program that facilitates calculations related to Simple Interest. It interacts with the user through a console interface, guiding them to enter values for Principal amount, Rate, and Time period to derive Simple Interest or related financial metrics.

Features
Calculates Simple Interest based on Principal amount, Rate of Interest, and Time period.
Provides the flexibility to calculate Principal amount, Rate, or Time period given the other variables.
Supports input for time in days, weeks, months, or years for more precise calculations.
Ensures ease of use by guiding the user through input prompts and clear instructions.
How to Use
Compile the Code

Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Compile the Main.java file using a Java compiler.
Run the Program

Execute the compiled code in a Java environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the calculation type and input the required values when prompted.
Input Instructions

Enter numerical values as prompted for Principal amount, Rate, and Time in specified units.
Choose the calculation type by entering the corresponding letter ('S', 'P', 'R', 'T').
Calculation Types
Simple Interest (S) Calculation

Derives the Simple Interest based on provided Principal amount, Rate, and Time in days, weeks, months, or years.
Principal amount (P) Calculation

Computes the Principal amount given the Simple Interest, Rate, and Time period in various units.
Rate of Interest (R) Calculation

Determines the Rate of Interest using the Simple Interest, Principal amount, and Time period in different time units.
Time period (T) Calculation

Calculates the Time period in years using Simple Interest, Principal amount, and Rate of Interest.
Input Instructions
Ensure input values are in the correct format (e.g., floating-point numbers for amounts, percentages for rates).
Follow the program's prompts to select the calculation type and provide necessary details.
Notes and Considerations
The program assumes a standard year as 365 days unless otherwise specified in weeks, months, or years.
It's essential to input accurate and valid values to obtain correct results.
Example Inputs
For 'S' (Simple Interest):
Provide Principal amount, Rate, and select a time unit (Days/Weeks/Months/Years).
For 'P' (Principal amount):
Enter Simple Interest, Rate, and choose a time unit.
For 'R' (Rate of Interest):
Input Simple Interest, Principal amount, and choose a time unit.
For 'T' (Time period):
Enter Simple Interest, Principal amount, and Rate.
Conclusion
This Simple Interest Calculator offers a convenient way to perform financial calculations quickly. Ensure accurate inputs and follow the instructions to obtain accurate results for Simple Interest, Principal amount, Rate, and Time period calculations.
